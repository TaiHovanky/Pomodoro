# Pomodoro
JavaScript Pomodoro Clock

This is a timer that enables the user to employ the Pomodoro technique. The Pomodoro technique involves timed intervals (typically 25 minutes) followed by short breaks (5 minutes).
This timer lets the user determine the work interval and the break interval that they would like to use. Once the work interval is over, the break interval begins automatically. Users can start, pause, and reset the timer.
